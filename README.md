# Adaptive RNN Wave Functions

A JAX-based implementation of **Adaptive Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Wave Functions/Quantum States** for ground state problems using Variational Monte Carlo (VMC). 

## ðŸš€ Overview

This project introduces **Adaptive RNN Wave Functions** for variational quantum Monte Carlo (VMC) simulations. Instead of fixing the architecture size from the start, the model **grows in complexity during training**, allowing better navigation of rugged optimization landscapes, reducing training runtime and even improving accuracy.
